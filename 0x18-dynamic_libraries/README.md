## Resources

### Read or watch

- [Difference between Dynamic and Static library (Static and Dynamic linking)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-library/)
- [Create Dynamic Libraries on Linux](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/shared-libraries-linux-gcc.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using external resources:

### General

- What is a dynamic library, how it works, how to create one, and how to use it
- How to use the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
- Differences between static and shared libraries
- Basic usage of `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig`

## Requirements

- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- No use of standard library functions (e.g., `printf`, `puts`, etc.)
- Allowed to use `_putchar`
- Do not push `_putchar.c`, as it will not be taken into account
- Prototypes of all functions and `_putchar` should be included in `main.h`
- Push the `main.h` header file

### Bash

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
